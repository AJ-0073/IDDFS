IDDFS Pathfinding Algorithm (Python)

This project implements Iterative Deepening Depth First Search (IDDFS) to find a path in a 2D grid. 
The grid contains free cells (0) and blocked cells (1). The algorithm gradually increases search depth until the target is found.

Features

Uses Depth-Limited Search (DLS) internally

Tracks Traversal Order and Final Path

Works on grid-based movement: Up, Down, Left, Right
